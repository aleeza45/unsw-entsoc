# Team Member Images

## Instructions for Adding Team Member Photos

### Anshita Agarwal
- **File needed:** `anshita-agarwal.jpg`
- **Location:** Place the image file in this directory (`public/images/team/`)
- **Image provided:** The image you shared in the chat (woman with long brown hair in black top with trophies in background)
- **Instagram:** https://www.instagram.com/anshita_agarwal_/
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshita-agarwal-ba0213281/

### How to add the image:
1. Save the image you provided as `anshita-agarwal.jpg`
2. Upload it to the `public/images/team/` directory
3. The website will automatically use this image for Anshita's profile

### For other team members:
When you have images for other team members, follow the same pattern:
- Save images as `firstname-lastname.jpg` (lowercase, with hyphens)
- Update the `imageUrl` in `src/data/teamMembers.ts` to point to `/images/team/filename.jpg`
- Update their social media links in the same file
- If they do not have an instagram or linkedin, instead use "#" as an entry.
